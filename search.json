    "text": "Introduction\nLarge Language Models such as GPT-3 excel at many NLP tasks but controlling the text generated and customizing the content is still a challenge. Existing prompting techniques are task-specific and not generalizable. Here we demonstrate an approach that non-experts can use for content generation that can be applied for a wide range of tasks.\n\n\n\nExamples of Customized Content Generation\nWe applied our technique to create the content generation applications listed below. The tasks chosen include those with creative content (poem, story, essay writing) as well as factual material (personal bio generation). The applications have been deployed as Streamlit apps and run on Azure.\nIn each of the apps, you will be asked a series of questions (generated dynamically, based on the task) and based on your response the app will generate customized content.\n\nPoem Generator App\nBiography Generator App\nStory Generator App\nCollege Essay Generator App\n\nThe next step is to implement these applications as an interactive conversational chat bot where the AI bot asks questions and generates content based on the responses, giving the user a chance to edit and suggest changes to the output from the bot.\n\n\n\nVideo Demos\nWe have also recorded demos of these apps and you can watch them from the links below.\n\nPoem Generator Demo Video\nBiography Generator Demo Video\nStory Generator Demo Video\nCollege Essay Generator Demo Video\n\n\n\n\nOur Approach\nWe have used a novel approach in creating these applications:\n\nTwo-step prompting strategy: one for dynamically generating a set of questions appropriate to the task based on the description of the task and the second for combining the responses to those questions in an output format that is appropriate to the task.\nOnline learning to incrementally improve the few-shot learning examples provided to the model: given that there are limitations on the size of the prompt, we provide a curated set of training examples. These come from voting/labeling by experts from past output of the app itself.\nEasily generalizable to other tasks: we have demonstrated that the approach works for creative as well as factual content and is generalizable.\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHelp Me Think paper on arxiv"
